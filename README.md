In this project, i had to made use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I have performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. I had also made use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.
